hoga is a self hosted frontend for archived galleries. it aims to make datahoarders, internet preservationists, and chronic archivers happy.

use plugins from the community to specify what type of content you want to serve - or, create your own plugin. 

## goals

* to make viewing large amounts of archived libraries easy

* the ability to have archived galleries **publicly accessible** with a hoga server (or, keep it as private as you want, and only run on your local machine)

* easy data _in_, easy data _out_. hoga will act as the middleman between the user and the data in its raw format (.json sidecars, .csv files, or even pure sql databases). downloading a hoga gallery will result in a .zip of the exact same data that was used for hoga.

## current status

still in the middle of figuring it out. check back soon^^
